# Tic-Tac-Toe-game ❗
T-T-T game developed by HTML, CSS &amp; JS. 

⚒ I made my own logic for AI.🔥 
At first computer will use randomly generated position and if this position is already used (for "X" || "O"), computer will capture first free cell (empty string in HTML element). If there is no free cell, so it will do nothing. It means game is over. It is totally defeatable AI :D. 

It is possible to achieve the following results: win ✅, lose ❌, draw ➗. 

⏳ Later I want to update AI to play more logically by any algorithm.
