# Tic-Tac-Toe-game ‚ùó
T-T-T game developed by HTML, CSS &amp; JS. 

‚öí I made my own logic for AI.üî• 
At first computer will use randomly generated position and if this position is already used (for "X" || "O"), computer will capture first free cell (empty string in HTML element). If there is no free cell (empty string), so it will do nothing. It is totally defeatable AI :D. 

‚è≥ Later I want to update AI to play more logically by any algorithm.
